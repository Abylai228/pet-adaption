# Project Title: Pet Adoption Management System
## Student Name: Abilai Shonoev

### Description:
The Pet Adoption Management System is a Java-based console application developed to streamline the process of managing pet information within an adoption center. This system offers a simple, text-based interface where users can add, update, remove, and view details of pets currently available for adoption. Each pet is assigned a unique ID and contains information such as name, type (e.g., dog, cat), and age.

The application leverages core object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, class abstraction, and method operations to model and manipulate pet data. By storing pet records in a HashMap, the system ensures quick access and management of individual pet entries. Designed with scalability in mind, this project serves as a foundational step toward building more complex systems such as web-based or mobile pet adoption platforms.


 # Objectives:
  ## The primary objectives of this project are:

To design and develop a basic but functional pet management system using Java.

To implement fundamental programming concepts such as classes, objects, conditionals, loops, and data structures.

To provide users with a straightforward and intuitive interface for managing pet information in real-time.

To simulate real-world use cases of adoption centers where tracking and maintaining up-to-date pet records is crucial.

To prepare a flexible codebase that can be extended with features like search, filtering, and persistent storage in future iterations.

This project not only demonstrates the application of Java programming skills but also emphasizes practical problem-solving in a real-life context. It is intended to be both educational and functional, giving the student hands-on experience in software development and user interaction.

Practice and apply object-oriented programming principles using Java.

Develop a user-friendly system that supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Enable real-time management of pet information through an interactive menu-driven interface.

Simulate a real-world application scenario, such as how shelters or adoption centers might manage their pet listings.

Lay the groundwork for future improvements, such as adding persistent storage, search features, or even a graphical user interface.
